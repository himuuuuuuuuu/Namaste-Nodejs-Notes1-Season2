#Microservices vs Monolithic
Waterfall Model(SDLC) [Software development life cycle]
.Requirements (Product Manager + Designer)
.Design (Senior Engineer and Enginerring Manager) (HLD and LLD)
.Development (SDE1,SDE2)
.Testing (SDET)
.Deployment (Devops Engineering Team)
.Maintainance

# Monolith vs Microservices Architecture:-
# What is Monolith and Microservices Architecture.
Monolith-one big single project like backend,db connection,frontend,emails,Authentication,email,Analytics
Microservices -only for BE,only for BE,only for Authentication,only for Notifiaction,only for Admin,only for Analytics.

# Monolith vs Microservices:-
-Dev Speed     is slower in Monolith but microservices is faster in dev speed in microservices built parelly project.
-code Repo   bcoz lot of people working on same repo,code review is slower it becomes tough excution  monolith .
-Scalabilty   very tidious thing in monlith bad in acalibilty but good in microservies.    
-Deployment - monolith in tough deployment.bcoz some small changes in monolith whole project deployment. 
-Tech Stack - react.angular.java
-Infra costs -infra based on traffic.monolith is lower infra cost. but microservies is infra cost os sliglthiy higher 
-Complexity -very small project is tough in microservices.monolith is complexity for large projects.
-Fault Isolation - suppose small error come than mmonlith is very complicated and tough.
-Testing -monolith is easy testing but micrservies is tough
-Ownership - monolith is central ownership .microservices is ownership of samll team.
-Maintainence -easier changes in microservices.
-Rewamps-
-Debugging- microservices cases in tough
-Dev Experience-

# What happens in Namaste dev.com

student web microservices    admin web 

techstack- next js            react js

backend is comman           student mobile app

node js                        React native

# What  we are going to build in Dev Tinder??
dev tinder project  uses two microservices. 
1. frontend -reactjs
devtinder.com/profile
API call /get profile

2. backend -nodejs
database

these two communicate in API call.
